# Client FUQs
## Developing

1. Get the *freaking* repo;
2. Go to the project root;
3. `npm install` - to install all deps;
4. I don't like this but you have to *goto -> .husky/pre-commit and add "npx" to the start of the "lint-staged" line*. Idk why it's not working properly
5. `npm start`

Do not forget about `npm test` and showing off with `coverage.png` sometimes!
