# Client FUQs

This project is about hate messages. Have you got pissed by your BOSS? Or your boyfriend has done something *out of charts*? You're here to post your message and no one will know that it's yours! Also, you can be a hate-influencer and like/share other peoples' messages too. The main page is totaly random! But do not get too salty and tedeous because the big badmin is watching
